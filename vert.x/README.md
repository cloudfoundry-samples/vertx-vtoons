# vert.x directory

This is the directory where we need to copy files from a vert.x download.

Copy the following directories from the vert.x distribution to this directory:

* bin
* conf
* lib

We also need the Cloud Foundry Java runtime support jar available at https://repo.springsource.org/simple/libs-milestone-s3-cache/org/cloudfoundry/cloudfoundry-runtime/0.8.1/cloudfoundry-runtime-0.8.1.jar

Put this jar in the vert.x/lib directory that you copied above.
